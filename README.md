# Keylogger Program (Task-04)

## Project Overview
This is a basic **Keylogger** program developed for educational purposes as part of an internship project. The program records and logs keystrokes pressed by the user and saves them into a file for review.

> **Note**: This program is intended strictly for **ethical and authorized use**. Always ensure proper permissions and legal compliance before deploying such tools.

---

## Features
- Logs keystrokes from the user.
- Saves recorded keys to a text file.
- Simple implementation for educational purposes.

---

## How It Works
1. The program listens for keystroke events on the system.
2. Each pressed key is recorded and logged in a text file (`keylog.txt`).
3. The program runs in the background to continuously monitor keypresses.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pynput` (install using `pip install pynput`).

---

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required library by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```
4. The program will start logging keystrokes and save them to a file named `keylog.txt`.

## Ethical Considerations
This keylogger is created for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always obtain **explicit consent** before deploying this program.
